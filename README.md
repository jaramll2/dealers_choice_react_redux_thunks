# Guidelines:
* build a simple Sequelize model and seed some data when the express application starts
* build an express api GET route which can be used by the client to return data from your model
* build out your front end slowly using redux, react-redux, redux-thunk. You can keep things in one file and separate things out as you get things working.
* add an api POST route on your server which will insert data (you can use faker to make things simpler and you can test this with curl)
* add the ability to create data in your react application
* add an api DELETE route on your server which can be used to delete data
* add the ability to destroy data in your react application
* deploy

## BONUS
* add an api PUT route on your server which can be used to update data
* add the ability to update data in your react application (for simplicity this might be a boolean property on your model)
* refactor- or add functionality or even another model
* add some links for filtering data by using the hashchange event
